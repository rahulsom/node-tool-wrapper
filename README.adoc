= Node Tool Wrapper

Some OSS projects have a README that says what version of Node to download and what version of npm/yarn/pnpm/etc. to use.

Some projects have no information and leave you to guess.

This project is inspired by Gradle's Wrapper.

== Example

1. Download `.ntw.sh` to your project's root directory.
2. Create a `yarnw` script that looks like this:
+
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

. .ntw.sh

selectNode v16.13.1
selectTool yarn 1.22.17

exec yarn "$@"
----
+
This will download the chosen node for your platform.
Then it will download yarn the version of yarn you choose.
`./yarnw` will function exactly like `yarn`.
+
Optionally, you can add this before sourcing `.ntw.sh` if you have a corporate proxy.
+
[source,bash]
----
export NTW_NODE_DIST_URL=https://artifactory.mycompany.comp/nodejs-dist
----

You can check in `yarnw` and `.ntw.sh` to your VCS.
